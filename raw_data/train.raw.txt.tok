expansion|||as we know , voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress|||in every presidential election over the past half century , except for the goldwater presidential candidacy , the gop has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for congress
expansion|||if these assumptions hold , voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner &apos;s dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean democratic|||if they put a republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from &quot; bringing home the bacon &quot; to their respective constituencies
expansion|||second , it explains why voters hold congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives|||any individual legislator &apos;s constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
expansion|||the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman republicans brought into office in 1980 by the reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982|||because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat
expansion|||fourth , the theory indicates why the republican party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office|||potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent
expansion|||fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the south|||to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in office
expansion|||finally , the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house|||since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their democratic counterparts
expansion|||this is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the house|||the democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded the republican house attendance rate since 1959
