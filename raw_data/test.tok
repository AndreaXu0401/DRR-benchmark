Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million &#124; &#124; &#124; These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related &quot; income

Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California &#124; &#124; &#124; We &apos;ve always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California &apos;s vitality , but maybe the state &apos;s la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment &#124; &#124; &#124; Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % &#124; &#124; &#124; Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback &#124; &#124; &#124; The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California &apos;s population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric &#124; &#124; &#124; Of course the state &apos;s liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; Golden West Financial Corp posted a 16 % increase of third-quarter earnings to $ 41.8 millon , or 66 cents a share &#124; &#124; &#124; The company earned $ 36 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-ago quarter

Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; Options markets stopped trading in many securities &#124; &#124; &#124; The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers &#124; &#124; &#124; To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies &#124; &#124; &#124; Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets ) be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions &#124; &#124; &#124; Of course , specialists &apos; actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices

Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; Bush is &quot; fully satisfied &quot; with CIA Director Webster and the intelligence agency &apos;s performance during the Oct. 3 failed coup in Panama &#124; &#124; &#124; that unidentified senior administration officials were frustrated with Webster &apos;s low-profile activities during the insurrection and wanted him replaced
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase &#124; &#124; &#124; As a U.S.-based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; but wouldn &apos;t specify how much &#124; &#124; &#124; People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower &apos;s good will
Comparison &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Farley said the sale of three of Cluett &apos;s four main divisions plus other &quot; anticipated &quot; West Point-Pepperell asset sales by December , should bring in a total of about $ 700 million &#124; &#124; &#124; He didn &apos;t elaborate on other asset sales being considered
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But IBM would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer &#124; &#124; &#124; IBM has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases

Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But those who said &quot; This can &apos;t be happening &quot; were right &#124; &#124; &#124; The Quotrons were wrong
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But it was the Quotron problems that had lingering effects &#124; &#124; &#124; that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification , and portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It was the second time in less than a week that Quotron has had problems calculating the industrial average &#124; &#124; &#124; At the start of trading last Wednesday , the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points .
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday &apos;s problems &#124; &#124; &#124; Quotron switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Today of all days &#124; &#124; &#124; The eyes of the world were watching us
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; At Scudder and at the smaller Ivy funds group in Hingham , Mass . , for instance , some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the switches &#124; &#124; &#124; Because mutual fund trades don &apos;t take effect until the market close these shareholders effectively stayed put
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions , however , some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests &#124; &#124; &#124; This avoids knocking down prices further
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The piano compositions are relentlessly tonal ( therefore unthreatening ) , unvaryingly rhythmic ( therefore soporific ) , and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic ( therefore both pretty and unconventional &#124; &#124; &#124; It is music for people who want to hear something different but don &apos;t want to work especially hard at the task
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum &quot; less is more &#124; &#124; &#124; His more is always less
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; There is a recognizable musical style here , but not a particular performance style &#124; &#124; &#124; The music is not especially pianistic
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; indeed , it &apos;s hard to imagine a bad performance of it &#124; &#124; &#124; Nothing bravura , no arpeggios , no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Nothing bravura , no arpeggios , no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer &#124; &#124; &#124; We hear , we may think , inner voices , but they all seem to be saying the same thing
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; He does this in at least three of his solo pieces &#124; &#124; &#124; You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass &apos;s music &#124; &#124; &#124; Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky , the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern , and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The blood flows to your head , you feel lightheaded and you don &apos;t feel tension around the head or neck &#124; &#124; &#124; When you leave the room after your massage , people say you look like you &apos;re glowing
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Last month , the complaints intensified and the massages ended &#124; &#124; &#124; Now we &apos;re looking for a room with thicker walls
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Massage also has an image problem to contend with &#124; &#124; &#124; Some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves &quot; bodyworkers &quot; and describing their office visits as &quot; reinvigoration breaks
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Phil Harms , a software engineer , was an eager customer &#124; &#124; &#124; You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; the department &apos;s supervised health facility would have been fine &#124; &#124; &#124; In my view , { massages } should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; This is common with a lot of large companies &#124; &#124; &#124; Managers are afraid how they &apos;re going to look in the eyes of their peers
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; I pull my hair back , wear a little makeup and look corporate &#124; &#124; &#124; If I go in there as I normally dress , they &apos;d ask , `Who is this hippie
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The self-proclaimed father of on-site massage is David Palmer , a 41-year-old San Francisco masseur whose mission is to save the touch-starved masses &#124; &#124; &#124; To help do this , Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes will bring &quot; structured touching &quot; into mainstream America
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The culture is not ready to take off its clothes , lie down and be touched for an hour for $ 45 &#124; &#124; &#124; The idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people seated
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Three minutes into the massage , the man curled up , began shaking and turned red &#124; &#124; &#124; Paramedics were called
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; that clothes ruin the experience &#124; &#124; &#124; There &apos;s nothing like skin to skin
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; We &apos;ve been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles talking to TV production people &#124; &#124; &#124; With the competitiveness of the television market these days , everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in 1990 , when a service called &quot; automatic number information &quot; will become widely available &#124; &#124; &#124; This service identifies each caller &apos;s phone number , and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; For a piece on local heroes of World War II , we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal &#124; &#124; &#124; That &apos;ll save us time and get people involved
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do &#124; &#124; &#124; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; but it is simply wrong &#124; &#124; &#124; The Clean Water Act contains no &quot; legal standard &quot; of zero discharge
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It requires that &quot; discharges of pollutants &quot; into the &quot; waters of the United States &quot; be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301 &#124; &#124; &#124; Whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects &quot; zero risk &quot; or &quot; zero discharge
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; and whether the infringement was &quot; willful and deliberate &#124; &#124; &#124; If so , the damages could be tripled
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; the fact that seven patents were infringed &quot; suggests that infringement was willful &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s difficult to be that consistently wrong
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; because it would result in a larger award &#124; &#124; &#124; it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by Kodak if Kodak hadn &apos;t entered the market
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The pricing will become more realistic , which should help management &#124; &#124; &#124; Investors aren &apos;t going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs , but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense , either
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But when prices were crazy , it was even harder to do an LBO &#124; &#124; &#124; Bankers believed in the greater-fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It would also help us in our search for equity partners &#124; &#124; &#124; To make an LBO work , now we are going to need more than just junk bonds
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete , especially at B. Altman &amp; Co . , which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection &#124; &#124; &#124; Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s called bad money driving out good money &#124; &#124; &#124; Institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values &#124; &#124; &#124; Retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But the junk recovery was precarious &#124; &#124; &#124; No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s possible to have a 10 % default rate in one year , because we &apos;re already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy &#124; &#124; &#124; I &apos;m certainly not comfortable saying we &apos;ve seen the bottom
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Sometimes a shakeout is healthy &#124; &#124; &#124; People will learn to be more circumspect
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Dictaphone Corp. was caught off guard in 1974 when its main competitor , Lanier Office Products of Japan , introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices &#124; &#124; &#124; Blocked by patent protection from following suit , Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again -- down to the length of a paperclip
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Blocked by patent protection from following suit , Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again &#124; &#124; &#124; By 1979 , designers and engineers at Dictaphone , a Pitney Bowes subsidiary , had produced a working model of a &quot; picocassette &quot; recorder

Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; That &apos;s not all &#124; &#124; &#124; Aer Rianta , the Irish airport authority , could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Moreover Irish companies are small but spunky &#124; &#124; &#124; We have to study their experience very well
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; We have to study their experience very well &#124; &#124; &#124; We must find any way to get business
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The Bush administration is seeking an understanding with Congress to ease restrictions on U.S. involvement in foreign coups that might result in the death of a country &apos;s leader &#124; &#124; &#124; that while Bush wouldn &apos;t alter a longstanding ban on such involvement , &quot; there &apos;s a clarification needed &quot; on its interpretation
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money &#124; &#124; &#124; A package of credit support was put together
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; and that demand in Korea will stay strong &#124; &#124; &#124; Currently only one in 38 South Koreans owns a car , up from one in 200 a decade ago
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Kia , the only Korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989 , aims at Korea &apos;s common man &#124; &#124; &#124; Its advantage has been the peppy little Pride , sold as the Ford Festiva in the U.S
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Its advantage has been the peppy little Pride , sold as the Ford Festiva in the U.S &#124; &#124; &#124; At 3.8 million won , or $ 5,700 , the econobox is the lowest-priced car in South Korea
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The Pentagon is a haunted house &#124; &#124; &#124; Living there for six years was really scary
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Living there for six years was really scary &#124; &#124; &#124; The ghosts of the past are everywhere
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; because Raeder &apos;s ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega &#124; &#124; &#124; The Command &apos;s huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act &apos;s six points , Cap Weinberger &apos;s seven points , the Intelligence Committee &apos;s 32 points and Woodrow Wilson &apos;s 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered in Cuba back in the &apos; 70s costs just a few hundred million : the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created in 1980 &#124; &#124; &#124; The brigade hasn &apos;t been heard from since , but we keep the staff around just in case
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; George Marshall &apos;s ghost is much more difficult to keep happy &#124; &#124; &#124; We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it &#124; &#124; &#124; Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the Army
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him &#124; &#124; &#124; Now his ghost won &apos;t let up till it &apos;s done
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But that ghost wasn &apos;t fooled &#124; &#124; &#124; he knew the RDF was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; One night both Marshall &apos;s ghost and the shah &apos;s ghost together caught Cap and threw him to the ground &#124; &#124; &#124; Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it Central Command
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Questions like that really stir up Marshall &apos;s ghost &#124; &#124; &#124; He appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary , Dick Cheney
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; On the other hand , Mr. Cheney retained all those new land forces &#124; &#124; &#124; Marshall &apos;s ghost is satisfied for now
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming , more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks &#124; &#124; &#124; They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; In the wake of Friday &apos;s plunge and yesterday &apos;s rebound , some companies are already postponing deals , and others wish they could &#124; &#124; &#124; As in other jittery times , many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals , seeking safety in bigger companies
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Life is particularly nerve-racking for companies that had planned to go public this week &#124; &#124; &#124; Hand-holding is becoming an investment-banking job requirement
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; We &apos;re making decisions on a day-to-day basis &#124; &#124; &#124; Debt-free and profitable , the Boulder , Colo . , computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an IPO now
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses &#124; &#124; &#124; In a sagging market , the Federal Reserve System &quot; might flood the market with funds , and that should bring interest rates down
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; the market &apos;s gyrations will underline the investors &apos; lack of control in big stock investments &#124; &#124; &#124; This will add to the appeal of small business where investors often have a degree of influence
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The once-staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy-turvy by a 1990s technology revolution &#124; &#124; &#124; New , efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller , less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But that won &apos;t suffice &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s no longer enough to beat the guy down the street
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; You have to beat everyone around the world &#124; &#124; &#124; He wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers &#124; &#124; &#124; They &apos;ve got too much invested in the old stuff
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers &#124; &#124; &#124; Nucor &apos;s plant in Crawfordsville , Ind . , ultimately will produce only one million tons annually , a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown &#124; &#124; &#124; On some days , the Nucor plant doesn &apos;t produce anything
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat &#124; &#124; &#124; After a while , someone has to go over the side
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; After a while , someone has to go over the side &#124; &#124; &#124; Although he doesn &apos;t expect any bankruptcies , he does see more plants being sold or closed
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Not to mention the incursion of imports &#124; &#124; &#124; Japanese and European steelmakers are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Algeria plans to increase natural-gas sales to Europe and the U.S &#124; &#124; &#124; According to the Middle East Economic Survey , the North African nation is holding talks with Italy for adding a fourth pipe to a section of the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline , expanding capacity by up to six billion cubic meters a year from 12.5 billion
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; because &quot; the contract &apos;s objectives can &apos;t be fulfilled &#124; &#124; &#124; Maine regulators &apos; refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through Maine to other utilities
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Maine regulators &apos; refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through Maine to other utilities &#124; &#124; &#124; It would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in 1992
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; John Peterpaul , Machinists union general vice president , attacked Mr. Wolf as &quot; greedy and irresponsible &quot; for pursuing the buy-out &#124; &#124; &#124; Although Mr. Wolf and John Pope , UAL &apos;s chief financial officer , stood to pocket $ 114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out , UAL executives planned to reinvest only $ 15 million in the new company
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The stock &apos;s decline also has left the UAL board in a quandary &#124; &#124; &#124; Although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out group can &apos;t revive its bid , it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group &apos;s original $ 300-a-share proposal
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; we see how pious cant subverts the soul &#124; &#124; &#124; Stevens &apos;s dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master &apos;s -- destroys all it was designed to preserve
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective &#124; &#124; &#124; It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; one &quot; possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position &#124; &#124; &#124; Such dignity &quot; has to do crucially with a butler &apos;s ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Such dignity &quot; has to do crucially with a butler &apos;s ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits &#124; &#124; &#124; He &quot; will not be shaken out by external events , however surprising , alarming or vexing
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; He &quot; will not be shaken out by external events , however surprising , alarming or vexing &#124; &#124; &#124; Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Despite his racial advantage , to be a great butler is a heroic calling &#124; &#124; &#124; one &apos;s pantry is &quot; not unlike general &apos;s headquarters during a battle
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Please don &apos;t think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment &#124; &#124; &#124; You see , I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable &#124; &#124; &#124; I will hereafter devote myself to serving him
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; I trusted in his lordship &apos;s wisdom &#124; &#124; &#124; I can &apos;t even say I made my own mistakes
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But the new lens became the eye of a storm &#124; &#124; &#124; In September 1971 California officials seized &quot; bootlegged &quot; lenses after some showed traces of bacteria
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; but indicated it intends to hold at least 20 % of the joint venture &apos;s stock long term &#124; &#124; &#124; A 20 % stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But quite a few money managers aren &apos;t buying it &#124; &#124; &#124; Weakening corporate earnings are no prescription for a bull market
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Some think investors should sell into rallies &#124; &#124; &#124; The market &quot; is going to wind down
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Nicholas Parks , a New York money manager , expects the market to decline about 15 % &#124; &#124; &#124; I &apos;ve been two-thirds in cash since July , and I continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; that having a defensive position is appropriate &#124; &#124; &#124; Companies that piled on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years &quot; will continue to surface as business problems
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; I still think we will have a 3000 Dow &#124; &#124; &#124; We &apos;re doing a little buying &quot; in some stocks &quot; that have really been smashed down
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The fundamentals are pretty strong &#124; &#124; &#124; I don &apos;t see this as a bear market at all
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Many investors have nagging worries , however &#124; &#124; &#124; Newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans .
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures , blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago &#124; &#124; &#124; Since the crash , many futures traders haven &apos;t assumed large positions for fear that the S &amp; P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart &#124; &#124; &#124; You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange &#124; &#124; &#124; While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations &#124; &#124; &#124; Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders &apos; customer orders
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they don &apos;t have a customer order in hand &#124; &#124; &#124; liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions &#124; &#124; &#124; The agency didn &apos;t cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 &#124; &#124; &#124; Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Dual trading is definitely worth saving &#124; &#124; &#124; It adds something to the market
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; He &apos;s written this book , `The Art of the Deal &#124; &#124; &#124; Why doesn &apos;t he just follow through on one of these things
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Trump &quot; is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle &#124; &#124; &#124; he still wants AMR
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; I was never sure Donald Trump really wanted to take AMR &#124; &#124; &#124; What happened with United was a gracious way for him to bow out
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the UAL group was willing to pay them &#124; &#124; &#124; the UAL buy-out group is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders &#124; &#124; &#124; The group &apos;s advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; especially since there aren &apos;t any competing bids &#124; &#124; &#124; Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis hasn &apos;t shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share back-up bid he made last month
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes &#124; &#124; &#124; If they were to insist on a low bid of , say $ 200 a share , the board mightn &apos;t be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Also , because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots &apos; bid , the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders &#124; &#124; &#124; That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude bankers have taken toward China since June 4 &#124; &#124; &#124; international lenders remain nervous about China &apos;s economic troubles and foreign debt -- $ 40 billion at the end of 1988
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; When the loan agreement was announced , it was hailed as one of the first Western-style financing transactions ever used in China &#124; &#124; &#124; Unlike most loans to China , there was no Chinese guarantor
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Last spring , the comptroller &apos;s office called a halt to Mr. Paul &apos;s fling , giving him six months to sell the paintings &#124; &#124; &#124; The acquisitions were &quot; unsafe , unsound and unauthorized
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The last six months has established the quality of the collection &#124; &#124; &#124; There &apos;s no fire sale here
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Paintings are just part of the picture &#124; &#124; &#124; Although Mr. Paul has pared a $ 1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ 900 million since April , the high-yield debt market has plummeted
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Although Mr. Paul has pared a $ 1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ 900 million since April , the high-yield debt market has plummeted &#124; &#124; &#124; Divesting itself of what is left , as is required of all thrift institutions by July 1994 under the new federal S &amp; L bailout law , may well prove difficult
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby &apos;s auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York &#124; &#124; &#124; There , on one of his first shopping trips , Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul &quot; was known to spend a lot of money &#124; &#124; &#124; People were interested in seeing him
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens &#124; &#124; &#124; It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Still , predicting is tricky &#124; &#124; &#124; I &apos;m forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Jonathan H. Kress , the son of the painting &apos;s former owner , Mrs. Rush Kress , dismisses the price talk as &quot; sour grapes &#124; &#124; &#124; Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Also , at any of Sotheby &apos;s auctions of old masters , roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered doesn &apos;t sell at any price &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s not that there aren &apos;t any bids , but the bids don &apos;t meet the minimum &quot; reserve &quot; prices set by the sellers
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn &#124; &#124; &#124; They went up 51 % last year , and they &apos;ll do it again this year
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; They were a sleeper &#124; &#124; &#124; Everybody was out buying Monets
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; that he relied too heavily on Sotheby &apos;s or Mr. Wachter &#124; &#124; &#124; he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; and that he never bid impulsively &#124; &#124; &#124; After all , he had the counsel of &quot; curators from the most reputable museums in the world
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; That is , he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon , and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works &#124; &#124; &#124; After a few years , you can argue there has been natural appreciation But quick turnover in artwork is &quot; like pawning your jewelry -- you end up with 50 %
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But quick turnover in artwork is &quot; like pawning your jewelry -- you end up with 50 % &#124; &#124; &#124; People hold out and try to get a bargain
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; I can &apos;t see why there would be a conflict of interest &#124; &#124; &#124; Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions , and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Automotive sales jumped 16 % to $ 791 million , mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems &#124; &#124; &#124; The group had an operating profit of $ 65 million , against a loss of $ 13 million a year earlier
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Reynolds is the third big aluminum company since Friday to report disappointing earnings &#124; &#124; &#124; The No. 1 domestic aluminum producer , Aluminum Co. of America , Friday said its earnings fell 3.2 % to $ 219 million , or $ 2.46 a share
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Advertisers don &apos;t think of the magazine first &#124; &#124; &#124; What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before &#124; &#124; &#124; It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices &#124; &#124; &#124; When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; his side is &quot; dead serious &#124; &#124; &#124; Although they don &apos;t contemplate delivering any disabling blows that Mr. Alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability , just in case
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive &#124; &#124; &#124; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; These rate indications aren &apos;t directly comparable &#124; &#124; &#124; lending practices vary widely by location
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that &quot; guarantees &quot; private market value after five years for the remaining shares &#124; &#124; &#124; McCaw has &quot; no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; In contrast , the Commerce Department &apos;s widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year &#124; &#124; &#124; Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year &apos;s end
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash &#124; &#124; &#124; It was an entirely different pattern from what we &apos;re seeing now
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push &#124; &#124; &#124; French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s just a strange feeling
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; They didn &apos;t &#124; &#124; &#124; The Dow accelerated its slide , losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; And this time , it wasn &apos;t just the program traders who were responsible &#124; &#124; &#124; All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; the opening was constructive &#124; &#124; &#124; It was orderly
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy &#124; &#124; &#124; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The institutions can &apos;t be criticized for their behavior &#124; &#124; &#124; It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; the U.S. won &apos;t accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. fish-processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season &apos;s catch &#124; &#124; &#124; the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D. , N.J. ) , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative &#124; &#124; &#124; The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg &apos;s jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with more than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; but then he had been up most of the night at home &#124; &#124; &#124; I had calls all night long from the States
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk &#124; &#124; &#124; This is not the sort of market to have a big position in
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; This is not the sort of market to have a big position in &#124; &#124; &#124; We tend to run a very tight book

Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down &#124; &#124; &#124; More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies

Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day &#124; &#124; &#124; Rally , rally , rally , &quot; shouted Shearson &apos;s Andy Rosen
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; By 10 : 25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors &#124; &#124; &#124; Among Big Board specialists , the cry was &quot; Pull your offers

Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Meanwhile , a test of the stock market &apos;s rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day &#124; &#124; &#124; bargain hunting had explained the Dow &apos;s strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow

Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; he remains uneasy &#124; &#124; &#124; We have half the experts saying one thing and half the other &quot; about the course of the economy
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; You &apos;re on a roller coaster , and that may last &#124; &#124; &#124; The public is still cautious
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market &#124; &#124; &#124; What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened &#124; &#124; &#124; There &apos;s a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; There &apos;s a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further &#124; &#124; &#124; He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; that Friday &apos;s stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday &#124; &#124; &#124; Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Last week that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company &#124; &#124; &#124; Now only minor points remain to be cleaned up
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; but it wasn &apos;t able to sustain the gain &#124; &#124; &#124; It was simply overbought
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; There is no pressing need to sell the unit &#124; &#124; &#124; We are only going to sell at the right price
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ 254 million from $ 347 million &#124; &#124; &#124; The interest rate on short-term funds was &quot; sharply higher
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; this is the best time to buy &#124; &#124; &#124; Those shares which had posted gains on M &amp; A speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there isn &apos;t much impact
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities &#124; &#124; &#124; Friday &apos;s Wall Street decline was &quot; well within the range of volatility &quot; that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20 % &#124; &#124; &#124; memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Of course it was &#124; &#124; &#124; NASA should now sue for fines against all three politico-plaintiffs , foreign and domestic , for bringing this mischievous case
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; but maybe the state &apos;s la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place &#124; &#124; &#124; What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state &apos;s attorney general
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed &#124; &#124; &#124; The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that don &apos;t meet the initiative &apos;s standards
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that don &apos;t meet the initiative &apos;s standards &#124; &#124; &#124; Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative ( on which there are no limits ) is gravy &#124; &#124; &#124; This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through &#124; &#124; &#124; This is the state that recently passed the Prop . 65 anti-toxic initiative
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; And at the company &apos;s Wichita , Kan . , plant , about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working &#124; &#124; &#124; Under Kansas right-to-work laws , contracts cannot require workers to be union members
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly &#124; &#124; &#124; There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they aren &apos;t based on fundamentals
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; This time , however , many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly &#124; &#124; &#124; They all went in the wrong direction
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic &#124; &#124; &#124; A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself .
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively &#124; &#124; &#124; Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open &#124; &#124; &#124; Let &apos;s not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; The moves also could erase shareholders &apos; perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil &#124; &#124; &#124; It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past
Contingency &#124; &#124; &#124; But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards &#124; &#124; &#124; Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice &apos;s wonderland

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital &#124; &#124; &#124; The piano compositions are relentlessly tonal ( therefore unthreatening ) , unvaryingly rhythmic ( therefore soporific ) , and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic ( therefore both pretty and unconventional
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It is music for people who want to hear something different but don &apos;t want to work especially hard at the task &#124; &#124; &#124; It is E-Z listening for the now generation
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; His more is always less &#124; &#124; &#124; Far from being minimalist , the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4 / 4 time , octave intervals , and ragtime or gospel chord progressions
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex &#124; &#124; &#124; Opening &quot; ( 1981 ) , from Glassworks , introduces the audience to the Glass technique
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Opening &quot; ( 1981 ) , from Glassworks , introduces the audience to the Glass technique &#124; &#124; &#124; Never straying too far from the piano &apos;s center , Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C , and his fingers seldom leave the keys
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; With &quot; Planet News Mr. Glass gets going &#124; &#124; &#124; His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard &#124; &#124; &#124; Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a ( very slow ) improvisatory riff
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard . &#124; &#124; &#124; The chords modulate
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard . &#124; &#124; &#124; Contrasts predictably accumulate
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Contrasts predictably accumulate : First the music is loud , then it becomes soft , then ( you realize ) it becomes louder again &#124; &#124; &#124; The Fourth Knee Play , &quot; an interlude from &quot; Einstein on the Beach , &quot; is like a toccata but it doesn &apos;t seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in &quot; Three Blind Mice
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; When Mr. Glass decides to get really fancy , he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand &#124; &#124; &#124; He does this in at least three of his solo pieces
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Not only is the typical Glasswork open-ended , it is also often multiple in its context ( s &#124; &#124; &#124; Mad Rush &quot; began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama &apos;s first public address in the U.S. , when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York &apos;s Cathedral of St. John the Divine .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The evening ended with Mr. Glass &apos;s &quot; Metamorphosis , &quot; another multiple work &#124; &#124; &#124; Parts 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris &apos;s acclaimed film , &quot; The Thin Blue Line , &quot; and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Parts 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris &apos;s acclaimed film , &quot; The Thin Blue Line &#124; &#124; &#124; When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; With a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background , the soothing hands of Sabina Vidunas begin to work on Ms. Foster &apos;s neck and shoulders &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s like an oasis in this room
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; on-site massage is certainly infiltrating corporate America &#124; &#124; &#124; In some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office , fearful that upper-level executives won &apos;t approve
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Not everyone , however , is at ease with office massage &#124; &#124; &#124; Three years ago , the Internal Revenue Service &apos;s office in San Jose , Calif . , opened its doors to on-site massage .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Given such attitudes , some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly &#124; &#124; &#124; Russell Borner of Park Ridge , N.J. , says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York -- unbeknownst to the company &apos;s executives
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; He visits the same department every two or three weeks &#124; &#124; &#124; His massage chair is kept in a closet , and a secretary escorts him past security
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; My vision is to change human consciousness towards touch &#124; &#124; &#124; My attitude is : Let &apos;s come out of the closet
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Occasionally , all that &apos;s needed is a little coaxing &#124; &#124; &#124; Elisa Byler , a St. Louis masseuse , won over officials at Emerson Electric Co . , a maker of electrical and electronic equipment , by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people seated &#124; &#124; &#124; The chair is a way to package massage
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Sitting in one of Mr. Palmer &apos;s chairs is a bit like straddling a recliner &#124; &#124; &#124; Customers lean forward , rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Customers lean forward , rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair &#124; &#124; &#124; she has heard the odd-looking contraption compared to something out of the Spanish Inquisition
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Scot MacInnis , a masseur in Boulder , Colo . , had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as part of a store promotion &#124; &#124; &#124; Three minutes into the massage , the man curled up , began shaking and turned red
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; there were still six people in line waiting for a massage &#124; &#124; &#124; The next woman was older , and I was afraid to touch her
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; some purists look down on it &#124; &#124; &#124; Linda Aldridge , who does full-body work in Pittsburgh , says that while on-site massage is better than nothing , tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The sales force is viewed as a critical asset in Integrated &apos;s attempt to sell its core companies &#124; &#124; &#124; Whitehall cited concerns about how long Integrated would be able to hold together the sales force as one reason its talks with Integrated failed
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Couch-potato jocks watching ABC &apos;s &quot; Monday Night Football &quot; can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays &#124; &#124; &#124; Two weeks ago , viewers of several NBC daytime consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life-style issues
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool &#124; &#124; &#124; Blair Entertainment has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Up to now , 900 numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels &#124; &#124; &#124; MTV used one to give away the house that rock star Jon Bon Jovi grew up in
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; MTV used one to give away the house that rock star Jon Bon Jovi grew up in &#124; &#124; &#124; For several years , Turner Broadcasting System &apos;s Cable News Network has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The newest uses of the 900-interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications &#124; &#124; &#124; Capital Cities / ABC Inc . , CBS Inc. and General Electric Co . &apos; s National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Capital Cities / ABC Inc . , CBS Inc. and General Electric Co . &apos; s National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger &#124; &#124; &#124; The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows , and viewers will be given a 900 number to call
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Other network applications have very different goals &#124; &#124; &#124; ABC Sports was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for &quot; Monday Night Football
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; ABC Sports was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for &quot; Monday Night Football &#124; &#124; &#124; that now &quot; tens of thousands &quot; of fans call its 900 number each week to vote for the best punt return , quarterback sack , etc
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; but ABC Sports also uses the calls as a sales tool &#124; &#124; &#124; After thanking callers for voting , Frank Gifford offers a football videotape for $ 19.95
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Each weekday matches a sponsor and a topic &#124; &#124; &#124; On Mondays , Unilever N.V. &apos; s Lever Bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise , followed by a 30-second Lever Bros. commercial
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Viewers can call a 900 number for additional advice , which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch ( &quot; Press one if you &apos;re pregnant , &quot; etc &#124; &#124; &#124; If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor , coupons and a newsletter will be mailed , and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; NBC has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time &#124; &#124; &#124; but to be about 40 % above regular daytime rates
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; TV executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for &quot; talk shows , game shows , news and opinion surveys &#124; &#124; &#124; Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in 1990 , when a service called &quot; automatic number information &quot; will become widely available
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Hard Copy , &quot; the new syndicated tabloid show from Paramount Pictures , will use its 900 number for additional purposes that include research &#124; &#124; &#124; For a piece on local heroes of World War II , we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But Mr. Monsky sees much bigger changes ahead &#124; &#124; &#124; These are just baby steps toward real interactive video , which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; These are just baby steps toward real interactive video , which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television &#124; &#124; &#124; Although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions , TV programmers could let audiences vote on different endings for a movie
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; TV programmers could let audiences vote on different endings for a movie &#124; &#124; &#124; Fox Broadcasting experimented with this concept last year when viewers of &quot; Married . . . With Children &quot; voted on whether Al should say &quot; I love you &quot; to Peg on Valentine &apos;s Day
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Someday , viewers may also choose different depths of news coverage &#124; &#124; &#124; A menu by phone could let you decide , `I &apos;m interested in just the beginning of story No. 1 , and I want story No. 2 in depth
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; A menu by phone could let you decide , `I &apos;m interested in just the beginning of story No. 1 , and I want story No. 2 in depth &#124; &#124; &#124; You &apos;ll start to see shows where viewers program the program
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Once again , your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions &#124; &#124; &#124; In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. Greve informs your readers , &quot; . . . the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge &quot; ( &quot; Congress &apos;s Environmental Buccaneers , &quot; Sept . 18 ) .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The Clean Water Act contains no &quot; legal standard &quot; of zero discharge &#124; &#124; &#124; It requires that &quot; discharges of pollutants &quot; into the &quot; waters of the United States &quot; be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Thus , you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests , even facetiously , that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water &#124; &#124; &#124; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters , from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station &#124; &#124; &#124; You might find something , but the chances are low
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; testimony by Kodak &apos;s patent counsel , Francis T. Carr of Kenyon &amp; Kenyon , showed that &quot; he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project &quot; in an effort to avoid infringement &#124; &#124; &#124; Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid &apos;s patent positions , &quot; and Kodak followed his advice in every instance
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor to testify on that issue &#124; &#124; &#124; Kodak hired Robert Buzzell and Polaroid brought in Robert J. Dolan
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies &#124; &#124; &#124; The chains include Bloomingdale &apos;s , owned by Campeau Corp. , Toronto ; Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field &apos;s , owned by B.A.T Industries PLC , London ; and B. Altman &amp; Co. and Sakowitz Inc . , owned by Hooker Corp. , which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers &apos; debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s called bad money driving out good money
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved &#124; &#124; &#124; Potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management , or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors &#124; &#124; &#124; Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology &apos;s Sloan School of Management , citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later , says , &quot; We &apos;re now in a period where we &apos;re starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Junk bonds are a highly stratified market &#124; &#124; &#124; There &apos;s a whole bunch of stuff that &apos;s money good and a whole bunch of stuff that &apos;s not so good
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Analysts at Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s say junk bond offerings by &quot; tightly stretched &quot; issuers seem to be growing &#124; &#124; &#124; Almost $ 8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from SCI TV , Gillette Holdings ( not related to Gillette Co . ) , Interco , Seaman Furniture , Allied Stores , Federated Department Stores , National Gypsum , M.D.C. Holdings , Micropolis , Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; You could still have some very bad times ahead &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s possible to have a 10 % default rate in one year , because we &apos;re already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But yesterday &apos;s rally among &quot; good &quot; junk was a badly needed tonic for the market &#124; &#124; &#124; Many issues &quot; bounced off the floor and benchmark junk issues &quot; recovered all of their losses &quot; from Friday and early yesterday
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; to be more circumspect &#124; &#124; &#124; If they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand grenades
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; If they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand grenades &#124; &#124; &#124; the market is in good shape
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and pricing &#124; &#124; &#124; its soft-drink prices were about 2 % higher in the quarter
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Led by Pizza Hut and Taco Bell , restaurant earnings increased about 25 % in the third quarter on a 22 % sales increase &#124; &#124; &#124; Same-store sales for Pizza Hut rose about 13 % , while Taco Bell &apos;s increased 22 % , as the chain continues to benefit from its price-value strategy
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; as the chain continues to benefit from its price-value strategy &#124; &#124; &#124; Taco Bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its tacos
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But only two-thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs &#124; &#124; &#124; Some are even coming up with their own novel designs
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; PRODUCTS DON &apos;T have to be first to be winners &#124; &#124; &#124; That &apos;s the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But others said pico should proceed &#124; &#124; &#124; Both were right
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985 , but it hasn &apos;t sold well &#124; &#124; &#124; To date it has &quot; broken even or shown a small loss
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways &#124; &#124; &#124; It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers , and it provided new technology for other company products
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; His crude device worked &#124; &#124; &#124; The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile , while the higher , harder teeth moved the top of the pile
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But other rake makers have their doubts &#124; &#124; &#124; Richard Mason , president of Ames Co. in Parkersburg , W. Va . , says the Barrett rake &quot; makes sense , &quot; but it would be &quot; tough &quot; to explain to consumers
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; people don &apos;t want to move a leaf pile &#124; &#124; &#124; They either pick it up or they start pulling from a fresh direction
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Aer Rianta , the Irish airport authority , could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union &#124; &#124; &#124; Aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to Aer Lingus , through GPA , for a joint-venture cargo airline
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. Ovcharenko &apos;s head ? Hardly &#124; &#124; &#124; The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport &#124; &#124; &#124; GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s &#124; &#124; &#124; Aer Lingus is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s . &#124; &#124; &#124; Aer Rianta already has so many ventures with Aeroflot that its chief executive is studying Russian
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Irish and Soviet people are similar &#124; &#124; &#124; They look the same
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; They look the same &#124; &#124; &#124; They &apos;re very friendly
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and Shannon Airport , the airline &apos;s largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union , saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through &#124; &#124; &#124; An apartment complex down the road is the crew-rest and staging area for more than 130 Aeroflot pilots and flight attendants
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The airport &apos;s biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union &#124; &#124; &#124; Tankers from the Latvian port of Ventspils each year unload 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; That isn &apos;t all &#124; &#124; &#124; Last year , the Irish airport authority , in a joint venture with Aeroflot , opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at Moscow &apos;s Sheremetyevo Airport
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Last year , the Irish airport authority , in a joint venture with Aeroflot , opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at Moscow &apos;s Sheremetyevo Airport &#124; &#124; &#124; Aer Rianta now manages duty-free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Last year , the Irish airport authority , in a joint venture with Aeroflot , opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at Moscow &apos;s Sheremetyevo Airport . &#124; &#124; &#124; Duty-free shops in Leningrad &apos;s Pulkova Airport opened in July
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Aeroflot &apos;s international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at Shannon Airport &#124; &#124; &#124; Thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of Irish travel agents to issue Aeroflot tickets , tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot &apos;s reasonable prices to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana , Kingston and Mexico City
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot &apos;s reasonable prices to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana , Kingston and Mexico City &#124; &#124; &#124; The round-trip fare to Havana is 410 Irish punts ( $ 578
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The round-trip fare to Havana is 410 Irish punts ( $ 578 &#124; &#124; &#124; Jamaica costs 504 punts
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It all started with geography &#124; &#124; &#124; When it opened in 1939 , Shannon was the first landfall in Europe for thirsty airplanes flying from North America
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Numerous injuries were reported &#124; &#124; &#124; Some buildings collapsed , gas and water lines ruptured and fires raged
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Some buildings collapsed , gas and water lines ruptured and fires raged &#124; &#124; &#124; The quake , which also caused damage in San Jose and Berkeley , knocked out electricity and telephones , cracked roadways and disrupted subway service in the Bay Area
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; NASA postponed the liftoff of the space shuttle Atlantis because of rain near the site of the launch pad in Cape Canaveral , Fla &#124; &#124; &#124; The flight was rescheduled for today
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Judge John E. Sprizzo issued the order in Manhattan federal court &#124; &#124; &#124; The judge held that the combination of colors used for the Sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under New York state law , rather than federal law
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that given the high degree of leverage in the options market , it is &quot; very easy for these guys to get wiped out &#124; &#124; &#124; That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Options traders who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling &#124; &#124; &#124; They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade &#124; &#124; &#124; that they wouldn &apos;t have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; but that conditions weren &apos;t dictated by those agencies &#124; &#124; &#124; It was their business decision
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets &#124; &#124; &#124; It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; They are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales &#124; &#124; &#124; South Korean consumers are expected to buy almost 500,000 passenger cars this year , up 60 % from 1988
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; As it is , waiting lists of a month aren &apos;t unusual for popular models &#124; &#124; &#124; Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- Hyundai , Kia Motors Corp. , Daewoo Motor Co. and even upstart SsangYong Motor Co . -- plan to build more factories
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- Hyundai , Kia Motors Corp. , Daewoo Motor Co. and even upstart SsangYong Motor Co . -- plan to build more factories &#124; &#124; &#124; Industry analysts predict that by 1995 , South Korea will be building three million cars a year -- about half of that for export
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The reason for the tremendous demand is simple &#124; &#124; &#124; South Koreans suddenly have a lot more money
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The reason for the tremendous demand is simple : South Koreans suddenly have a lot more money &#124; &#124; &#124; We never thought we &apos;d own a car , &quot; says Kwang Ok Kyong , who just bought a Daewoo LeMans on a five-year loan
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; SsangYong began making variations of the Jeep-like &quot; Korando &quot; vehicle . ( Dong-A had had a technology agreement with Jeep maker American Motors Corp. , now a part of Chrysler Corp &#124; &#124; &#124; The most popular style is the stretched &quot; Family , &quot; which resembles a Ford Bronco or Chevy Blazer
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The four-wheel-drive vehicles start at $ 15,000 &#124; &#124; &#124; a Family can cost over $ 25,000
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; SsangYong will sell about 18,000 of its models this year , twice as many as last year &#124; &#124; &#124; It sees sales rising 45 % to 26,000 units next year
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Kia is the most aggressive of the Korean Big Three in offering financing &#124; &#124; &#124; Loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible , with monthly payments as low as 80,000 won , or $ 120
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Daewoo Motor , a 50-50 joint venture with General Motors Corp. and the Daewoo Group conglomerate , is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting &#124; &#124; &#124; Shipments of its Lemans to GM &apos;s Pontiac division are off about 65 % from a year ago , versus a 44 % decline for Hyundai and an 18 % increase for Kia
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Kia is reportedly also considering such a plan &#124; &#124; &#124; Even giant Samsung Group is rumored in the Korean press to be considering getting into the auto-making business
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Some can be bought off relatively cheaply &#124; &#124; &#124; During the Korean War , Gen. Douglas MacArthur demanded and got , in addition to his U.N. command in Korea , his own naval command in Japan , NavforJapan
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; During the Korean War , Gen. Douglas MacArthur demanded and got , in addition to his U.N. command in Korea , his own naval command in Japan , NavforJapan &#124; &#124; &#124; Those obsolete operations cost less than $ 2 billion a year , and keep Mac &apos;s ghost quiet
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; That &apos;s about all it costs to appease Adm. Erich Raeder &apos;s ghost &#124; &#124; &#124; In 1941 , Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal , so we created the Southern Command in Panama
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; so we created the Southern Command in Panama &#124; &#124; &#124; The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder &apos;s ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon : statues , busts , relics and such &#124; &#124; &#124; The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the shah of Iran &#124; &#124; &#124; When the shah died , President Carter was so scared that the shah &apos;s ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; When the shah died , President Carter was so scared that the shah &apos;s ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; I saw what he did to them firsthand &#124; &#124; &#124; It made my shoelaces dance with terror
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It made my shoelaces dance with terror &#124; &#124; &#124; Why , he used to lay in wait for Cap ; suddenly he &apos;d leap from behind some statue of Marshall onto Cap &apos;s chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional $ 2 billion or so
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Cap added four more divisions to the Army , two active and two reserve ; two carrier groups to the Navy ; a division -- equivalent to the Marines ; and the C-5B , KC-10 , C-17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force &#124; &#124; &#124; He bought $ 4 billion in prepositioning ships and $ 7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them , and parked them at a new $ 6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it Central Command &#124; &#124; &#124; He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers &#124; &#124; &#124; They had fun moving the carriers around
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Still , Berbera was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with President Barrah &#124; &#124; &#124; All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Then the whole thing will start to collapse , just as it did in the 1970s , and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people &apos;s hair white &#124; &#124; &#124; Gives me the willies just thinking about it
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically &#124; &#124; &#124; The more variables that indicate risk , the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Other companies figure they can &apos;t avoid the market &#124; &#124; &#124; We have capital requirements , &quot; says Mr. Linsert , &quot; so we have to go ahead &quot; with a planned $ 1.5 billion private placement
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; because the market for IPOs was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness &#124; &#124; &#124; We were just beginning to look at the increase in IPOs , seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Companies planning to go public &quot; are definitely taking a second look , &quot; says Allen Hadhazy , senior analyst at the Institute for Econometric Research , Fort Lauderdale , Fla . , which publishes the New Issues newsletter on IPOs &#124; &#124; &#124; He calculates that the recent market slide translated into a 5 % to 7 % reduction in IPO proceeds to companies
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Many companies are hesitating &#124; &#124; &#124; Exabyte Corp. had been planning to sell 10 % of its stock this week in an IPO that would raise up to $ 28.5 million
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; it is still planning to go ahead with its IPO this week or next -- unless conditions change &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s a wait-and-see situation right now
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies &#124; &#124; &#124; Sierra Tucson Cos . , a Tucson , Ariz . , operator of addiction-treatment centers , has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for next week
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the market turmoil &quot; is an absolute non-event for small business &#124; &#124; &#124; For small companies interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations &#124; &#124; &#124; Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently &#124; &#124; &#124; Some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds &#124; &#124; &#124; Alan Wells , president of Bollinger , Wells , Lett &amp; Co . , a New York merger specialist , thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The new technology radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets &#124; &#124; &#124; the company &apos;s plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours , compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; We &apos;ve had the Russians and Chinese , and people from India visiting us &#124; &#124; &#124; Everyone in the world is watching us very closely
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Especially his neighbors , the major U.S. steelmakers &#124; &#124; &#124; Already , USX Corp. and Armco Inc. are studying Nucor &apos;s technology to see if they can adopt it
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Already , USX Corp. and Armco Inc. are studying Nucor &apos;s technology to see if they can adopt it &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s damn worrisome
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But such thin-slab technology is only the beginning &#124; &#124; &#124; Eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting , which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s no longer enough to beat the guy down the street &#124; &#124; &#124; You have to beat everyone around the world
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Moreover , the process isn &apos;t without its headaches &#124; &#124; &#124; Because all operations are connected , one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In the past steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock &#124; &#124; &#124; We said : `We &apos;ve got a product : if you want it , you can buy it
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But steelmakers must also find new markets &#124; &#124; &#124; After letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead , a group of the nation &apos;s largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Still others are looking at overseas markets &#124; &#124; &#124; USX is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry Soviet Union
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; USX is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry Soviet Union &#124; &#124; &#124; This year , the nation &apos;s largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output , such as coated and electrogalvanized products &#124; &#124; &#124; Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But unfortunately , that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Robert Crandall , with the Brookings Institute , agrees &#124; &#124; &#124; Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it &apos;s unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Moreover , the U.S. can expect more competition from low-cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries &#124; &#124; &#124; A Taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a Nucor-like plant
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But opponents fear overcrowding &#124; &#124; &#124; This city already has too many tourists , and it can &apos;t hold them all , &quot; says Pierluigi Beggiato , the president of the Venice hoteliers association
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Not all Poles are pleased &#124; &#124; &#124; What do we want casinos for when we haven &apos;t got anything in the shops ? &quot; one housewife asked
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; plans had called for 7,000 copies of the monthly Are Paev ( Business Paper ) to be sold at newsstands and an additional 3,000 promotion issues to be sent by direct mail &#124; &#124; &#124; 13,000 more copies were sent to Estonia because of strong sales
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Maine regulators &apos; refusal to approve the contract means Central Maine Power has lost its place in line &#124; &#124; &#124; We won &apos;t sign any new contracts { with deliveries } beginning earlier than 2000
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; We won &apos;t sign any new contracts { with deliveries } beginning earlier than 2000 &#124; &#124; &#124; Hydro-Quebec already has some &quot; customers in mind &quot; for the power that was to be delivered to Maine
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; He said Hydro-Quebec already has some &quot; customers in mind &quot; for the power that was to be delivered to Maine &#124; &#124; &#124; Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost , most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers &apos; energy needs through the year 2020 , &quot; said Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The stock has fallen $ 87.25 , or 31 % , in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $ 300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its second-worst plunge ever &#124; &#124; &#124; This is a total bloodbath &quot; for takeover-stock traders
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Adding insult to injury , United &apos;s 25,000-member Machinists &apos; union , which helped scuttle financing for the first bid , yesterday asked UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL directors to resign &#124; &#124; &#124; A similar demand was made by a group that represents some of United &apos;s 26,000 noncontract employees
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The huge drop in UAL stock prompted one takeover stock trader , George Kellner , managing partner of Kellner , DiLeo &amp; Co . , to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Kellner said that despite losses on UAL stock , his firm &apos;s health is &quot; excellent
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Berlitz intends to pay quarterly dividends on the stock &#124; &#124; &#124; it expects to pay the first dividend , of 12.5 cents a share , in the 1990 first quarter
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Certain details of the restructured facilities remain to be negotiated &#124; &#124; &#124; The agreement is subject to completion of a definitive amendment and appropriate approvals
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In fact , Kazuo Ishiguro &apos;s &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; ( Knopf , 245 pages , $ 18.95 ) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them &#124; &#124; &#124; It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects &apos; minds , manners and morals , and argues , tacitly , that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery , willful blindness , role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Stevens &apos;s dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master &apos;s -- destroys all it was designed to preserve &#124; &#124; &#124; Such armor crushes the soldier
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Such armor crushes the soldier &#124; &#124; &#124; The mask cuts to the quick
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart &#124; &#124; &#124; What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty , its sense of restraint
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; what is a `great &apos; butler &#124; &#124; &#124; one &quot; possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years , he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster &#124; &#124; &#124; With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and ( utterly repressed ) sexual love , but British anti-Semitism , the gentry &apos;s impatience with democracy and support of Hitler , and the moral problematics of loyalty
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable . &#124; &#124; &#124; This is loyalty intelligently bestowed
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; I trusted &#124; &#124; &#124; I trusted in his lordship &apos;s wisdom
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; I can &apos;t even say I made my own mistakes &#124; &#124; &#124; Really what dignity is there in that
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For the nine months , Honeywell reported earnings of $ 212.1 million , or $ 4.92 a share , compared with earnings of $ 47.9 million , or $ 1.13 a share , a year earlier &#124; &#124; &#124; Sales declined slightly to $ 5.17 billion
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The stock market ain &apos;t going to do much of anything &quot; for a while &#124; &#124; &#124; that Friday &apos;s market decline may have a second leg , perhaps a 10 % to 15 % drop later on
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The market &quot; is going to wind down &#124; &#124; &#124; Things are a little less overpriced &quot; after Friday &apos;s jolt in the market .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Things are a little less overpriced &quot; after Friday &apos;s jolt in the market &#124; &#124; &#124; stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 %
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; After Friday &apos;s decline , Mr. Perritt &apos;s firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks &#124; &#124; &#124; He found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Money manager Robert Ross , head of Duncan Ross Associates Ltd. in Vancouver , British Columbia , says stocks would have to fall 15 % to 20 % before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives &#124; &#124; &#124; Fredric Russell , a money manager in Tulsa , Okla . , says Friday &apos;s cave-in &quot; is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want to admit
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; There are still bulls out there &#124; &#124; &#124; I still think we will have a 3000 Dow , whether it &apos;s six months or 12 months from now I don &apos;t know , &quot; says David Dreman , managing partner of Dreman Value Management in New York
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Many brokerage house officials also are optimistic &#124; &#124; &#124; Yesterday , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Yesterday , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks &#124; &#124; &#124; Dean Witter now recommends 85 % , Goldman 65 % and Merrill Lynch 50 %
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Friday &apos;s sell-off was a good thing , because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation &#124; &#124; &#124; It was a healthy cleansing
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; I don &apos;t see this as a bear market at all &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the LBO market
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Friday &apos;s big fall was &quot; just a blunder by the stock market &#124; &#124; &#124; It was an overreaction to an event that doesn &apos;t mean that much to lots of stocks
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead &#124; &#124; &#124; Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters , &quot; says Mary Farrell , a market strategist at PaineWebber
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the market could drop about 10 % in the next few months , then recover and go higher &#124; &#124; &#124; Companies with steady earnings growth could do well while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10 %
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; More than 400 traders jammed the S &amp; P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell &#124; &#124; &#124; Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8 : 30 am
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Several of Wall Street &apos;s largest securities firms , including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc . , were also large buyers &#124; &#124; &#124; Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products , which they sell for close to wholesale prices in no-frills stores &#124; &#124; &#124; Shoppers , many of whom operate small businesses , pay annual membership fees , which provide an income base for the stores
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But some analysts contend K mart has agreed to pay too much for Pace &#124; &#124; &#124; Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it &apos;s expensive , &quot; said Wayne Hood of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it &apos;s expensive &#124; &#124; &#124; In my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal &#124; &#124; &#124; If K mart can &apos;t get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; If K mart can &apos;t get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets &#124; &#124; &#124; K mart &apos;s number one job is to address its market-share loss { in discount stores } , which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , K mart closed yesterday at $ 36 a share , up 12.5 cents &#124; &#124; &#124; Pace rose $ 2.625 to close at $ 22.125 a share in national over-the-counter trading
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Among the conditions of the offer is that Pace shareholders tender a majority of the company &apos;s shares outstanding &#124; &#124; &#124; Pace would ill continue to operate under its present management
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The study , by the CFTC &apos;s division of economic analysis , shows that &quot; a trade is a trade &#124; &#124; &#124; Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis doesn &apos;t seem to have much economic impact
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations &#124; &#124; &#124; The House &apos;s bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The House &apos;s bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more &#124; &#124; &#124; The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange can &apos;t show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; So far , one test of restricting dual trading has worked well &#124; &#124; &#124; The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers &#124; &#124; &#124; Traders who stand on the pit &apos;s top step , where most customer orders are executed , can &apos;t trade for themselves
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the plan hasn &apos;t made much difference in liquidity in the pit &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s too soon to tell . . . but people don &apos;t seem to be unhappy with it
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s too soon to tell . . . but people don &apos;t seem to be unhappy with it , &quot; he said &#124; &#124; &#124; He said he wouldn &apos;t comment on the CFTC plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal &#124; &#124; &#124; After reaching an intraday high of $ 107.50 the day Mr. Trump disclosed his bid Oct. 5 , AMR &apos;s stock had retreated as low as $ 97.75 last week
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; He still hasn &apos;t proven his mettle as a big-league take-out artist &#124; &#124; &#124; He &apos;s done this thing where he &apos;ll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs &#124; &#124; &#124; Yesterday , Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress , saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump might come back with a lower bid &#124; &#124; &#124; Ray Neidl of Dillon Read &amp; Co. said Mr. Trump &quot; is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But others remained skeptical &#124; &#124; &#124; I was never sure Donald Trump really wanted to take AMR , &quot; said John Mattis , a bond analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Many loans are being renegotiated , especially those tied to the hotel sector , which has been hit hard by a post-June 4 tourism slump &#124; &#124; &#124; Many bankers view property-sector loans as particularly risky
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The canceled Shanghai loan leaves Asia Development , a small concern , saddled with a half-completed 32-story apartment building and heavy debts &#124; &#124; &#124; The company owes $ 11 million to the Shui On Group , the project &apos;s Hong Kong contractor , and a significant , though unspecified , amount in legal fees to Coudert Brothers , a U.S. law firm
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Instead , the banks secured a promise from state-owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire $ 55 million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing &#124; &#124; &#124; The loan was to have matured in just two to three years , as soon as construction was completed
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; At the moment , however , the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive , David L. Paul &#124; &#124; &#124; In an international buying spree that began barely two years ago , Mr. Paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works , including the Preti , at a total cost of $ 28 million .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The rub is that the $ 28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S &amp; L in the first place -- it isn &apos;t on the comptroller &apos;s &quot; permissible &quot; list -- without seeking a special dispensation , which he did not do
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; And CenTrust has other problems &#124; &#124; &#124; Late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul has a plan to bring in $ 150 million by selling off 63 of CenTrust &apos;s 71 branches , but it has yet to be approved by regulators
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It is Mr. Paul &apos;s art venture , however , that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators , not to mention galleries throughout the world &#124; &#124; &#124; Embittered shareholders ( some of whom are suing ) say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S &amp; L crisis
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Embittered shareholders ( some of whom are suing ) say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S &amp; L crisis &#124; &#124; &#124; CenTrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ 15.125 in 1986 to close yesterday at $ 2.875
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Collectors don &apos;t say &quot; It &apos;s a van Gogh &quot; anymore &#124; &#124; &#124; They say , `Johnny Payson got $ 53 million for his , so certainly $ 10 million isn &apos;t too much for mine
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Payson , an art dealer and collector , sold Vincent van Gogh &apos;s &quot; Irises &quot; at a Sotheby &apos;s auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; He paid $ 2.2 million , for instance , for a still life by Jan Jansz. den Uyl that was expected to fetch perhaps $ 700,000 &#124; &#124; &#124; The price paid was a record for the artist
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Some 64 % of items offered at the Guterman auction were sold , at an average price of $ 343,333 &#124; &#124; &#124; The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul denies phoning and gloating &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s just not true , &quot; he says
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters CenTrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year &#124; &#124; &#124; Sotheby &apos;s was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its U.S. business
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In March 1989 , just 15 months into his campaign , Mr. Paul was named by Art &amp; Antiques magazine as one of the top 100 individual collectors in the U.S &#124; &#124; &#124; An unknown quantity to most of the art world , Paul is no stranger to lavish spending , &quot; the magazine said
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that he doesn &apos;t stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat &#124; &#124; &#124; He recently bid $ 30,000 at a Paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world &apos;s great chefs , but the final party cost closer to $ 100,000
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In other words : Get rid of all the pictures &#124; &#124; &#124; The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For instance , he got a $ 3 million loan from the S &amp; L , negotiated at a below-market rate &#124; &#124; &#124; He owns 43 % of CenTrust &apos;s shares
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The $ 12 million lavished on the Rubens , for example , was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among scholars about its provenance &#124; &#124; &#124; scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event &#124; &#124; &#124; It sounds like with the Rubens he got absolutely taken to the cleaners
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $ 12 million , but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself &#124; &#124; &#124; Most of them weren &apos;t even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Art prices are skyrocketing , but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales &#124; &#124; &#124; Salomon Brothers Inc . , the investment-banking firm , in its annual tally of investment returns , reported that old masters appreciated 51 % in the year ended June 1 , the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction &#124; &#124; &#124; Art indexes track winners , not losers
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; They went up 51 % last year , and they &apos;ll do it again this year &#124; &#124; &#124; They were a sleeper
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; a number of { the artworks } have already been sold , and at a substantial profit &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul claims to have sold three paintings , at more than a 10 % profit
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Sotheby &apos;s defends itself and Mr. Paul in the matter &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Wachter says Mr. Paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; it &quot; definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased &#124; &#124; &#124; Sotheby &apos;s is &quot; wearing both hats
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be &#124; &#124; &#124; Frequently , clients express interest in paintings but don &apos;t end up bidding
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and { Sotheby &apos;s } wouldn &apos;t do it &#124; &#124; &#124; They were protecting his interests
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Meanwhile , Mr. Paul and CenTrust executives are getting squeamish about opulence &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul has been characterized as &quot; the Great Gatsby or something , &quot; complains Karen E. Brinkman , an executive vice president of CenTrust
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul has been characterized as &quot; the Great Gatsby or something &#124; &#124; &#124; The media have distorted his personal life
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Paul nods in agreement &#124; &#124; &#124; I don &apos;t think I have a life style that is , frankly , so flamboyant , &quot; he says
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the ceiling in his executive suite is gold-leaf inlay &#124; &#124; &#124; The offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Don &apos;t say it &apos;s a gold ceiling &#124; &#124; &#124; Just say the offices are tastefully appointed
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $ 1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units , partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems &#124; &#124; &#124; The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For the nine months , TRW &apos;s net was $ 199 million , or $ 3.22 a share , down 3 % from $ 205 million , or $ 3.33 a share , a year earlier &#124; &#124; &#124; Sales rose 2.9 % to $ 5.42 billion , from $ 5.27 billion
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Reynolds Metals Co. said third-quarter net income dropped nearly 10 % to $ 123.7 million , or $ 2.10 a share , from $ 137.2 million , or $ 2.56 a share , a year earlier &#124; &#124; &#124; The latest earnings reflect an increase of about 5.5 million in common shares outstanding
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Reynolds Metals Co. said third-quarter net income dropped nearly 10 % to $ 123.7 million , or $ 2.10 a share , from $ 137.2 million , or $ 2.56 a share , a year earlier . &#124; &#124; &#124; Revenue rose 3 % to $ 1.52 billion from $ 1.48 billion
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the ingot price &quot; appears to have bottomed out &#124; &#124; &#124; shipments are continuing at a &quot; healthy &quot; pace and the company has no excess inventory
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; shipments are continuing at a &quot; healthy &quot; pace and the company has no excess inventory &#124; &#124; &#124; Aluminum shipments of 329,600 metric tons were nearly equal to the year-earlier period
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the magazine just hasn &apos;t kept up with the times &#124; &#124; &#124; it hasn &apos;t been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back &#124; &#124; &#124; It now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been beefing up its sales force
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The campaign takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for &#124; &#124; &#124; In one ad , a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline , &quot; The only book more respected than ours doesn &apos;t accept advertising
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In one ad , a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline , &quot; The only book more respected than ours doesn &apos;t accept advertising &#124; &#124; &#124; Another ad pictures a tree ant , magnified 80 times , with the headline , &quot; For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of National Geographic &#124; &#124; &#124; We want it to be a &apos; 90s kind of image
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; some details are in place &#124; &#124; &#124; he agreed to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares &#124; &#124; &#124; McCaw &apos;s revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses &#124; &#124; &#124; BellSouth has notified LIN that it would &quot; shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; McCaw has &quot; no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain &#124; &#124; &#124; that McCaw would be able to control LIN &apos;s operations and could , &quot; therefore , operate LIN in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Dataproducts announced a restructuring plan in September &#124; &#124; &#124; The company &apos;s restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March &#124; &#124; &#124; The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well &#124; &#124; &#124; They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Underlying this optimism is the index &apos;s longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department &apos;s index of leading indicators &#124; &#124; &#124; Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression &#124; &#124; &#124; The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index &#124; &#124; &#124; It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday &apos;s 190.58-point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 &#124; &#124; &#124; It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders &#124; &#124; &#124; A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday &apos;s late Big Board plunge
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday &apos;s late Big Board plunge &#124; &#124; &#124; The Nasdaq OTC index closed down 6.31 to 460.98

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Overall , &quot; this is a pleasant rally but it &apos;s very selective &#124; &#124; &#124; Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s just a strange feeling &#124; &#124; &#124; anyone left the place whistling Dixie
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized &#124; &#124; &#124; They didn &apos;t
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the &quot; first thing we did was to double our orders &quot; yesterday morning &#124; &#124; &#124; With the market down like this , we &apos;ll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in &quot; the market
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders &apos; eyes &#124; &#124; &#124; According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday &apos;s gridlock &#124; &#124; &#124; At Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc . , head equity trader Dudley Eppel said : &quot; I think the opening was constructive
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It was orderly &#124; &#124; &#124; We put some orders together
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; We put some orders together &#124; &#124; &#124; There wasn &apos;t a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; There wasn &apos;t a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally &#124; &#124; &#124; Not like Friday where they just took { the market } apart
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval &#124; &#124; &#124; Grinned Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . &apos; s OTC department : &quot; I tell you , this market acts healthy

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday &#124; &#124; &#124; Futures were pulling the stock market higher , &quot; said Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings &#124; &#124; &#124; Merrill Lynch added 1 3 / 4 to 28 , PaineWebber rose 3 / 4 to 18 1 / 2 and Bear Stearns rose 3 / 8 to 14 1 / 4
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday &#124; &#124; &#124; Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it &apos;s going to make everybody nervous , including me , &quot; he said
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson &apos;s head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq &apos;s biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors &#124; &#124; &#124; The institutions can &apos;t be criticized for their behavior , &quot; Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the performance of specialists during Friday &apos;s plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and weren &apos;t reopened before the close &#124; &#124; &#124; They did an excellent job
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument &#124; &#124; &#124; We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel &apos;s ruling &quot; that the &quot; landing requirement &quot; also must be ended

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor &#124; &#124; &#124; Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black-and-white portrait orders
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; What &apos;s happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography &#124; &#124; &#124; On Seventh Avenue , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones &#124; &#124; &#124; At Kodak , which largely ignored the market for years , black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company &apos;s $ 3 billion in film and paper sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Also trying to snare a portion of the $ 2 billion-a-year industry is Agfa Corp. , a unit of Bayer AG &#124; &#124; &#124; Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that &apos;s geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak &apos;s papers &#124; &#124; &#124; Slated for market by the end of the year , the paper &quot; could have been introduced a long time ago but the market wasn &apos;t there then , &quot; says an Agfa spokesman
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be International Paper Co . &apos; s Ilford division , known in the industry for its premium products &#124; &#124; &#124; Sales of Ilford &apos;s four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the company won &apos;t say by exactly how much
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye-catching and exotic &#124; &#124; &#124; It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it &#124; &#124; &#124; You can shift out of reality with black and white
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising &#124; &#124; &#124; Processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped 24 % last year to 18.7 million rolls
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Other companies are introducing related products &#124; &#124; &#124; Charles Beseler Co . , a leading maker of photographic enlargers , introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen-agers who want to process their own black-and-white photographs
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The kit , which has a suggested retail price of $ 250 and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children &apos;s photography equipment &#124; &#124; &#124; It seems computers as hobbies have waned
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the resurgence of black and white is only a fad &#124; &#124; &#124; the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Black and white hasn &apos;t made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color &#124; &#124; &#124; The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa &#124; &#124; &#124; SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the &quot; sole , authentic representative &quot; of Namibia &apos;s people in
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters &#124; &#124; &#124; The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It now has the chance to redress that record in Namibia &#124; &#124; &#124; State and the human-rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United Nation &apos;s monitors make certain that Mr. O &apos;Linn &apos;s commission investigates election complaints from all sides
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package &#124; &#124; &#124; Last month , the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature , the Sejm , in democratic procedures
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1 / 2 % &#124; &#124; &#124; The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3 / 4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 %
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week &#124; &#124; &#124; Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities &#124; &#124; &#124; After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday , they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But prices of junk bonds rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session &#124; &#124; &#124; Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; trading in Tokyo was &quot; very active &quot; but highly volatile &#124; &#124; &#124; We went down 3 / 4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch , then after lunch we went up 3 / 4 point in 12 minutes
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2 % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report &#124; &#124; &#124; The August trade deficit is expected to have widened to $ 9.1 billion from $ 7.58 billion in July
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; A widening of that magnitude is &quot; not a favorable number &#124; &#124; &#124; It could do damage to us
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Short-term interest rates fell yesterday at the government &apos;s weekly Treasury bill auction &#124; &#124; &#124; The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.37 % , the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on Oct. 17 , 1988
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.37 % , the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on Oct. 17 , 1988 &#124; &#124; &#124; The average discount rate was 7.42 % on new six-month bills , the lowest since the average of 7.35 % at the auction on July 31 , 1989
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Trading was hectic during the morning , with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday &apos;s free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness &#124; &#124; &#124; Tax-exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash wasn &apos;t at hand
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Florida Board of Education &apos;s 7 1 / 4 % issue of 2023 was 5 / 8 point weaker at 99 1 / 2 bid &#124; &#124; &#124; The 7 1 / 8 % issue of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York , due 2019 , was off 5 / 8 at 98 1 / 8 bid
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems &#124; &#124; &#124; Church &apos;s Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye &apos;s Famous Fried Chicken Inc . , which have merged , are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; A Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman , however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued &#124; &#124; &#124; He says the test is continuing in Chicago , Columbus , Ohio , and a few other cities
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; CALL IT un-advertising &#124; &#124; &#124; Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shun pushy ads

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; There &apos;s always a risk of lost messages &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But in the end , customers &apos; wishes are what will prevail &#124; &#124; &#124; Big Bear doesn &apos;t care for disposable diapers , which aren &apos;t biodegradable .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For the third year in a row , consumers voted Bill Cosby first and James Garner second in persuasiveness as spokesmen in TV commercials , according to Video Storyboard Tests , New York &#124; &#124; &#124; Michael J. Fox replaced Bruce Willis in third place
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For the third year in a row , consumers voted Bill Cosby first and James Garner second in persuasiveness as spokesmen in TV commercials , according to Video Storyboard Tests , New York . &#124; &#124; &#124; Cher placed fourth for the second time
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and the mean ol &apos; law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend &#124; &#124; &#124; The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A &apos;s
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A &apos;s catcher , Terry Steinbach &#124; &#124; &#124; He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team &apos;s lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts &#124; &#124; &#124; Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he &apos;d had in the five-game Dodger series in which he &apos;d gone 1-for-17
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he &apos;d had in the five-game Dodger series in which he &apos;d gone 1-for-17 &#124; &#124; &#124; The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the &quot; bottom of the order , &quot; got seven of their team &apos;s 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs ( 29 of 39 ) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all &#124; &#124; &#124; That &apos;s not an average to soothe Giant rooters
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; but they observe them in relative calm &#124; &#124; &#124; Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams &#124; &#124; &#124; I &apos;m for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; I &apos;m for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday &#124; &#124; &#124; I love &apos; em both
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Anyway , the A &apos;s gave you a lot of heroes to root for &#124; &#124; &#124; In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery &#124; &#124; &#124; He was flawless afield ( ditto in game two ) , moved a runner along in the A &apos;s three-run second inning , and homered for his team &apos;s final tally
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; An A &apos;s co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation &#124; &#124; &#124; He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run &#124; &#124; &#124; When you &apos;re in the groove , you see every ball tremendously
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side &#124; &#124; &#124; When it goes , you never know when you &apos;ll get it back , &quot; he said
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; When it goes , you never know when you &apos;ll get it back &#124; &#124; &#124; That &apos;s baseball
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; the third-quarter earnings that the company plans to report Oct. 24 are expected to be up &#124; &#124; &#124; he was &quot; comfortable &quot; with revised analysts &apos; projections that the company would report earnings of between 62 cents and 64 cents a share , compared with the 53 cents a share it reported for the 1988 third quarter
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 a share from $ 1.26 a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan &#124; &#124; &#124; Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million &#124; &#124; &#124; Revenue fell 1 % to $ 1.39 billion from $ 1.41 billion
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ 5.35 a share from $ 5.50 a share &#124; &#124; &#124; Revenue projections were slashed to $ 6.03 billion from $ 6.20 billion
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For the nine months , the company &apos;s earnings fell 9 % to $ 264.6 million , or $ 3.40 a share , from $ 289.7 million , or $ 3.49 a share &#124; &#124; &#124; Revenues declined 1 % to $ 4.17 billion from $ 4.19 billion
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For the 12 weeks ended Sept . 3 , Skipper &apos;s had net income of $ 361,000 , or 13 cents a share , compared with a net loss a year earlier &#124; &#124; &#124; Revenue was $ 19.9 million
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade &#124; &#124; &#124; When asked &quot; What went wrong ? &quot; the unfortunate victim replied , &quot; It was a combination of things
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses &#124; &#124; &#124; UAL opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday &apos;s close
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; UAL opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday &apos;s close &#124; &#124; &#124; AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday &apos;s close
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday &apos;s close . &#124; &#124; &#124; Both took further hits yesterday
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday &apos;s close . &#124; &#124; &#124; Paramount lost almost 11 %
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday &apos;s dramatic march for several weeks &#124; &#124; &#124; The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau &apos;s retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; These are all market excesses ( putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity ) , and what we &apos;ve seen is the market reining them in &#124; &#124; &#124; Of course , Washington hadn &apos;t been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps shouldn &apos;t distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior &#124; &#124; &#124; The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings &#124; &#124; &#124; The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; but they rode the tiger up all year &#124; &#124; &#124; Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump &#124; &#124; &#124; In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar ( D. , Minn . ) , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information hasn &apos;t been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest &#124; &#124; &#124; If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; For the nine months , the newspaper chain had almost a 23 % increase in profit to $ 23.6 million , or 83 cents a share , from $ 19.2 million , or 68 cents a share &#124; &#124; &#124; Sales grew almost 7 % to $ 279.1 million from $ 261.3 million
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Guber-Peters &apos;s net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $ 6.9 million , or 62 cents a share , in the year-earlier period &#124; &#124; &#124; revenue rose 138 % , to $ 10.9 million from $ 4.6 million
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; it reduced its rating on $ 281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company , to C from Ca &#124; &#124; &#124; it confirmed American Continental &apos;s preferred stock rating at C
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long-term deposits to B-3 from Ba-3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa &#124; &#124; &#124; about $ 85 million in securities was affected
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs &#124; &#124; &#124; It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 &#124; &#124; &#124; reduce ( or even eliminate ) FHA down-payment requirements

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce ( or even eliminate ) FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide &quot; adequate &quot; funding for the Farmers Home Administration ( FmHA &#124; &#124; &#124; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and localities
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; More important , housing programs run by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink &#124; &#124; &#124; The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 &#124; &#124; &#124; the government &apos;s equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government &apos;s equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion &#124; &#124; &#124; The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government &apos;s equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion . &#124; &#124; &#124; All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In its nicely produced publication &quot; Where Will Our Children Live ? &quot; the NAHB does acknowledge that &quot; of course , the full measure of housing affordability cannot be provided by the federal government &#124; &#124; &#124; It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The association , a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business lobbies &#124; &#124; &#124; It treads in two worlds
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Unfortunately , the organization &apos;s desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility &#124; &#124; &#124; Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill , the organization &quot; basically dropped out of the taxpayers &apos; coalition
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Government is not going to solve the problem &#124; &#124; &#124; The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The bill would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that wouldn &apos;t be counted on the federal budget &#124; &#124; &#124; to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Absent other working capital the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets &#124; &#124; &#124; We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian &#124; &#124; &#124; The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of Black Monday as prices recovered from an early slide , spurred by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders &#124; &#124; &#124; The Dow Jones industrials closed up 88.12 points , at 2657.38 , the fourth-biggest gain ever , after being down as much as 63.52 points in the morning
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The dollar also rebounded , while bond prices plummeted and Treasury bill rates soared &#124; &#124; &#124; Junk bonds also recovered somewhat , though trading remained stalled
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Junk bonds also recovered somewhat , though trading remained stalled &#124; &#124; &#124; Gold also rose

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; More taunting in the parking lot led to a fight &#124; &#124; &#124; he was punched and kicked by one player and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Many also use recruiting bonuses , tuition reimbursement , loan repayment or child-care help &#124; &#124; &#124; Some give lump-sum incentives
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s in their top five &quot; work values &#124; &#124; &#124; Fully 80 % of employees who say their bosses treat them with respect , but only a third of those who don &apos;t feel respected say they &apos;re satisfied with where they work
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; CURBING WAGE BOOSTS will get high priority again in 1990 collective bargaining &#124; &#124; &#124; Despite labor-shortage warnings , 80 % aim for first-year wage increases of under 4 %
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; TEMPORARY WORKERS have good educations &#124; &#124; &#124; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows 82 % with more than a high-school education , and 31 % with college degrees
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows 82 % with more than a high-school education , and 31 % with college degrees &#124; &#124; &#124; About 12 % have retired from a full-time job , while 54 % were asked to stay on full time
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; About 72 % reimburse for all or some losses &#124; &#124; &#124; Since 1984 , more companies give sales-loss aid , as many real-estate values depreciated
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Since 1984 , more companies give sales-loss aid &#124; &#124; &#124; RJR Nabisco pays up to $ 30,000 of losses , including improvements
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; but will prevent a &quot; catastrophic loss &#124; &#124; &#124; it has given some employees the full purchase price when values fell from concern over dangers posed by a disposal site
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night &#124; &#124; &#124; Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night . &#124; &#124; &#124; Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Today &apos;s Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity &#124; &#124; &#124; Underneath the headline &quot; Diversification , &quot; it counsels , &quot; Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market &apos;s volatility . &quot; It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash &#124; &#124; &#124; In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The new PaineWebber commercial features Mary Farrell , one of the firm &apos;s most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish &#124; &#124; &#124; Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , &quot; We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle . . . . We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation

Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value hasn &apos;t changed &#124; &#124; &#124; This isn &apos;t 1987 revisited
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach &#124; &#124; &#124; At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Big Board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone &#124; &#124; &#124; They said the exchange &apos;s trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other exchanges couldn &apos;t have performed better
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; We had no operating problems at all &#124; &#124; &#124; All the things that we set up to slow down the process worked extremely well
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Prices for the 416.3 million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange &apos;s trading tape with barely a delay &#124; &#124; &#124; While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and its profits have dropped &#124; &#124; &#124; Last year &apos;s earnings of $ 1.3 million , including $ 815,000 from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim &#124; &#124; &#124; The Butler , Wis . , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim &apos;s goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and Mr. Sim &apos;s goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 &#124; &#124; &#124; Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation &quot; very similar &quot; to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 &#124; &#124; &#124; Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family &#124; &#124; &#124; While profitable , it &quot; wasn &apos;t growing and wasn &apos;t providing a satisfactory return on invested capital
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company &apos;s acquisition program &#124; &#124; &#124; Sales climbed to an estimated $ 245 million in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ 99.9 million in fiscal 1985
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Sales climbed to an estimated $ 245 million in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ 99.9 million in fiscal 1985 &#124; &#124; &#124; The company expects that earnings reached about $ 20.8 million , or $ 1.58 a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ 15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million in 1985
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; its board has instructed management to accept inquiries from any others interested in making a bid &#124; &#124; &#124; it can withdraw from the merger agreement with Memotec if a better bid surfaces
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday &apos;s dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity &#124; &#124; &#124; Many went bargain-hunting
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and Tokyo &apos;s leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading &#124; &#124; &#124; Other , more thinly traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo &apos;s , but there were no free-fall declines
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash &#124; &#124; &#124; In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few hours &apos; time must be expected
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In Somerset , Wis . , Adrian Sween agrees &#124; &#124; &#124; I look at it as a ho-hum matter
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Many other factors played a part in yesterday &apos;s comeback &#124; &#124; &#124; The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity &#124; &#124; &#124; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day &#124; &#124; &#124; Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts &#124; &#124; &#124; The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen , bounced back strongly to 141.8 , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday &apos;s &#124; &#124; &#124; There is too much complacency , &quot; says money manager Barry Schrager
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start &#124; &#124; &#124; The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Unlike two years ago , most of Japan &apos;s major investors chose to sit this calamity out &#124; &#124; &#124; In Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . &apos; s Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The relative calm in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe &#124; &#124; &#124; Frankfurt &apos;s opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Frankfurt &apos;s opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders &#124; &#124; &#124; The beginning was chaotic
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points &#124; &#124; &#124; With sell orders piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow couldn &apos;t open on time
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; But shortly before then they sensed a turn &#124; &#124; &#124; The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Shearson &apos;s London trading room went wild &#124; &#124; &#124; Traders shouted out as their Reuters , Quotron and Telerate screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It was bedlam on the upside &#124; &#124; &#124; What we had was a real , old-fashioned rally
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Typical , perhaps , was Batterymarch &apos;s Dean LeBaron &#124; &#124; &#124; Mr. LeBaron , who manages $ 10 billion , says , &quot; We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed to do
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Not everybody was making money &#124; &#124; &#124; The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation &apos;s major options market , was heavy after the trading in S &amp; P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Across the country , many people took yesterday &apos;s events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general &#124; &#124; &#124; Says James Norman , the mayor of Ava , Mo . : &quot; I don &apos;t invest in stocks .
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; 2.6 million shares have been purchased since then &#124; &#124; &#124; it will buy additional shares &quot; from time to time in the open market or in private transactions at prevailing market prices
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy &#124; &#124; &#124; Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $ 5.163 &#124; &#124; &#124; Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and gold prices surged as the stock market fell &#124; &#124; &#124; The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ 471.60
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Yesterday &apos;s October gain of $ 4 was miniscule compared with that &#124; &#124; &#124; the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit &#124; &#124; &#124; This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices &#124; &#124; &#124; The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ 20.59 a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong &#124; &#124; &#124; The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Futures prices fell &#124; &#124; &#124; The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745 &#124; &#124; &#124; Prices were down from the outset of trading
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Now only minor points remain to be cleaned up &#124; &#124; &#124; For all intents and purposes , an agreement appears to have been achieved
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market &#124; &#124; &#124; At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 , but it wasn &apos;t able to sustain the gain
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Futures prices eased &#124; &#124; &#124; The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound , at 74.48 cents
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Futures prices declined &#124; &#124; &#124; The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market &#124; &#124; &#124; India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , &quot; said Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Under the agreement , Intel will invest $ 3 million to acquire a 4 % stake in Alliant , a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers &#124; &#124; &#124; Alliant will license its parallel-computing technologies to Intel , providing users a way to let many i860 microprocessors in a single computer work on a problem simultaneously
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance &#124; &#124; &#124; Whirpool said , &quot; We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related &quot; income &#124; &#124; &#124; Non-interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 496 million
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The Charlotte , N.C. , company said earnings rose to $ 143.6 million , or $ 1.45 a share , from $ 58.9 million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier &#124; &#124; &#124; The latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB &apos;s problem loans , particularly in the Southeast &#124; &#124; &#124; In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ 474.1 million , or 1.43 % of net loans and leases , from $ 232.8 million , or 1.13 % in the second quarter
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise &#124; &#124; &#124; it purchased both Freedom Savings &amp; Loan Association , Tampa , Fla . , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ 169.4 million
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Security Pacific &apos;s loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ 30.4 million , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before &#124; &#124; &#124; Non-interest income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday &apos;s trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points , to 35133.83 &#124; &#124; &#124; By 10 a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up 435.11 points , to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York &apos;s overnight rally
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; as our policy now is to wait and see &#124; &#124; &#124; We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market &apos;s second section also posted their biggest decline of the year &#124; &#124; &#124; The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96 , or 2.7 % , to 3655.40
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders &#124; &#124; &#124; For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Isao Ushikubo , general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust &amp; Banking Co . , also was optimistic &#124; &#124; &#124; He described Friday &apos;s plunge in the U.S. as a &quot; fleeting &quot; event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Other fund managers were similarly sanguine &#124; &#124; &#124; We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , &quot; said Masato Murakami , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore &apos;s Straits Times Industrial Index down 10 % &#124; &#124; &#124; Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong &#124; &#124; &#124; Bangkok , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It &apos;s pure psychology &#124; &#124; &#124; Markets in this region aren &apos;t so geared to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there &apos;s no doubt that Asia is still following America &apos;s lead
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is &#124; &#124; &#124; that even after Monday &apos;s 10 % decline , the Straits Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70 &#124; &#124; &#124; Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with 473.9 million Friday
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; but is close &#124; &#124; &#124; If New York doesn &apos;t collapse , I see maybe another 5 % on the downside
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The Financial Times 30-share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7 &#124; &#124; &#124; Volume more than doubled to 959.3 million shares from 457.7 million Friday
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading &#124; &#124; &#124; The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points , or 12.8 % , to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market &apos;s steepest fall ever
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; West Germany &apos;s Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter &#124; &#124; &#124; The anti-defense Greens wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today &apos;s scheduled liftoff long enough for them to ask the World Court to &quot; order &quot; a permanent cancellation of the $ 1.5 billion flight
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; As usual the green lobby &apos;s proposal is disconnected from scientific reality &#124; &#124; &#124; Consider the greenhouse-effect provision
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Consider the greenhouse-effect provision &#124; &#124; &#124; The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 %
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp &#124; &#124; &#124; He &apos;s running for governor
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 &#124; &#124; &#124; That &apos;s also the day of the gubernatorial election
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits &#124; &#124; &#124; He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign &#124; &#124; &#124; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative is gravy
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation &#124; &#124; &#124; taxpayers would bear the cost
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one &#124; &#124; &#124; We &apos;re encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout 1989 , and topped $ 11 billion at quarter &apos;s end for the first time in the company &apos;s history &#124; &#124; &#124; Deposit growth amounted to $ 393 million , more than double the year-ago figure
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; but they aren &apos;t based on fundamentals &#124; &#124; &#124; The economy of West Germany and the EC { European Community } is highly stable
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Paris also was hard hit &#124; &#124; &#124; Share prices fell in Milan , Amsterdam , Zurich , Madrid and Stockholm
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe &apos;s strongest economy &#124; &#124; &#124; The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8 % , a one-day record , wiping out the summer &apos;s gains
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; The beginning was chaotic &#124; &#124; &#124; It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Institutional investors and bankers were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices &#124; &#124; &#124; Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; Late buying gave the Paris Bourse a parachute after its free fall early in the day &#124; &#124; &#124; The CAC General Index ended down 5.4 % at 523.6 , a drop of 29.6 points from Friday
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before &#124; &#124; &#124; When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening , there was panic buying in Paris
Expansion &#124; &#124; &#124; After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose &#124; &#124; &#124; The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours
